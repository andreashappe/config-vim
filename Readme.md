# Currently installed Plugins:

* ag -- fast grep replacement, needs the_silver_searcher
* ctrlp.vim -- TextMate-like ctrl-t/p file switcher
* ultisnips & vim-snippets -- TextMate-like code snippets, needs python
* vim-surround -- for changing strings delimiters, etc.
* vim-fugitive -- for interacting with git
* syntastic -- automatic syntax checking on save, can be CPU-heavy

And then there's stuff that I'm currently testing, but haven't added them to my workflow yet

* vim-bundler -- needed for vim-rails or vim-ruby-refactoring
* vim-rails -- lots of rails related stuff which I'm currenlty not really using
* vim-ruby-refactoring -- sounds interesting, haven't used it yet
